# Voice-to-Morse-Interactive-LED-Communication
"Voice-to-Morse" captures user voice input from a web browser using p5.js sound library. It sends the data to Arduino, which processes and displays it on an LED strip using Morse code. An engaging project combining web-based voice capture, Arduino processing, and LED visualization.
