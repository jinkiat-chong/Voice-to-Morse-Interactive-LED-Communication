**Voice-to-Morse-Interactive-LED-Communication**
The "Voice-to-Morse: Interactive LED Communication" project aims to create an engaging and interactive experience by combining web-based voice capture with Arduino processing to display messages on an LED strip using Morse code.

Utilizing the sound library from p5.js, the project enables users to provide voice input through a web browser. The captured audio data is then transmitted to an Arduino microcontroller for further processing. The Arduino, acting as an intermediary, decodes the voice input and converts it into corresponding Morse code signals.

The Morse code signals are then translated into visual cues and displayed on an LED strip. Each dot or dash of the Morse code is represented by a specific lighting pattern on the LED strip, providing a visual representation of the captured voice message. Users can observe the LED strip as it dynamically changes to reflect the real-time Morse code translation.

By combining voice input, Arduino processing, and LED visualization, the project offers an interactive way for users to communicate and explore the world of Morse code. It promotes learning and experimentation while also showcasing the versatility of p5.js and Arduino as powerful tools for creative projects.
